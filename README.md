Modulo Project Thomas Hynes

The Main class is the entry point for the project

To use this project, first run the code then you may manually enter a specific value of times table number or number
of points around the circle into the correctly labeled text box this value will be accepted once you hit the enter 
key. By doing this, you can get a look at any individual frame that you may not be able to notice when the animation
is running.

the color option will let you change the color of the drawing, by selecting cycle you will be cycled through each of 
the ten circles when the animation timer is not set to pause.

clicking start will start your animation and pause will pause your animation, starting the animation will cycle through the 
drawing created by incrementing the previous drawings times table by one. Clicking pause will stop on any given frame 
of the animation, changing the settings while the animation is paused is useful to test various numbers of points,
colors, and times tables.

I do not think that there are any noticeable bugs other than the errors that result from entering values that fall 
outside of integers in the given text boxes.

As far as I know, all project requirements are met.
