Modulo Project Thomas Hynes

The Main class is the entry point for the project

As far as I know, all project requirements are met.

To use this project, first run the code then you may manually enter a specific value
of times table or number of points around the circle that will be accepted once you hit
the enter key. By doing this, you can get a look at any individual frame that you may not
be able to notice when the animation is running.

the color option will let you change the color of the drawing, by selecting cycle you will
be cycled through each of the ten circles when the animation timer is not set to pause.

start will start your animation and pause will pause your animation, starting the animation
will cycle through the drawing created by incrementing the previous drawings times table by
one. Pause will stop on any given frame of the animation.

I do not think that there are any noticeable bugs other than the errors that result
from entering values that fall outside of integers in the given text boxes.
